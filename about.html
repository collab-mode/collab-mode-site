Collab-mode is a collaborative editing mode for the beloved text editor Emacs.<br> 
Collab-mode focuses on ease of use and interoperability. Behind the scenes it uses the popular Infinote<br> 
protocol. That means that collab-mode can easily work with any other collaborative editor that uses <br>
the Infinote protocol such as the widely used open-source editor Gobby. Collab-mode uses your existing Google account<br> to connect you with your friends so that you can edit your documents and source<br> 
code with them. Since collab-mode utilizes XMPP, you can also chat with your friends about your <br>
document or invite them to join you. As the creator of Emacs Richard Stallman once said, “Collaborative<br> 
editing in Emacs is the most desirable thing.”
