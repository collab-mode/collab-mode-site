    <div class="body">
	 Collab-mode is a collaborative editing mode for the beloved text editor Emacs. 
	 Collab-mode focuses on ease of use and interoperability. Behind the scenes it uses the popular Infinote 
	 protocol. That means that collab-mode can easily work with any other collaborative editor that uses 
	 the Infinote protocol such as the widely used open-source editor Gobby. Collab-mode uses your existing Google account to connect you with your friends so that you can edit your documents and source 
	 code with them. Since collab-mode utilizes XMPP, you can also chat with your friends about your 
	 document or invite them to join you. As the creator of Emacs Richard Stallman once said, “Collaborative 
	 editing in Emacs is the most desirable thing.”
